## üìä Glass Identification Classification Project

### üìÇ Dataset Overview
This project uses the **Glass Identification Dataset**, a well-known dataset used for classification problems. It contains **chemical composition data** for different types of glass. The goal is to classify the **type of glass** based on its elemental composition.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RI | Refractive Index |
| Na | Sodium |
| Mg | Magnesium |
| Al | Aluminum |
| Si | Silicon |
| K | Potassium |
| Ca | Calcium |
| Ba | Barium |
| Fe | Iron |
| Type | Glass type (target class, ranging from 1 to 7) |

There are **7 types of glass** to classify:
1. Building windows (float processed)
2. Building windows (non-float processed)
3. Vehicle windows (float processed)
4. Containers
5. Tableware
6. Headlamps

### üîÑ Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed missing values.
   - Removed duplicate rows.
   - Converted the `Type` column into a factor (categorical variable).

2. **Normalization**:
   - All numerical features were normalized using **centering** and **scaling** to improve model performance.

3. **Train-Test Split**:
   - The data was split into **80% training data** and **20% test data**, sampled randomly.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Handling Imbalanced Data
- The training set was balanced using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**.
- SMOTE generates synthetic samples for minority classes, helping the model better detect all glass types.

---

### ü§ñ Model
- The classification model used is **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**.
- Key model parameters:
    - **Objective**: multi:softmax (for multiclass classification).
    - **Evaluation Metric**: mlogloss (multiclass log-loss).
    - **Number of Classes**: 7 (representing the 7 glass types).

- Training includes **early stopping** if the evaluation metric does not improve after 10 consecutive rounds.

---

### üìä Evaluation
- Model performance is evaluated using a **Confusion Matrix** and **Overall Accuracy**.
- Final predictions are converted back to their original class labels (1-7) for comparison with the actual labels.

---

### üöÄ Tools & Libraries
This project was implemented using **R**, with the following libraries:

- `readr`: for data import.
- `data.table`: for efficient data manipulation.
- `caret`: for preprocessing.
- `xgboost`: for training the classification model.
- `smotefamily`: for applying SMOTE to balance the training data.
