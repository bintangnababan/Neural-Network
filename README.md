# Neural Network Modeling for Glass Classification

This repository contains R code for building a neural network model to classify glass types using the Glass dataset. The neural network is constructed using the `neuralnet` library, and the entire process includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

## Overview

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The neural network learns patterns and relationships within the data through a process called training, adjusting the weights associated with each connection.

## Code Highlights

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning

The initial steps involve loading the Glass dataset, converting it to a data.table, and performing data cleaning by removing missing values and duplicates.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is conducted through scatterplot matrices, summary statistics, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

### 3. Feature Engineering

Numeric variable normalization is performed using the `caret` library to ensure consistent scaling across features.

### 4. Data Splitting

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 5. Neural Network Modeling

A neural network model is constructed using the `neuralnet` library, with the number of hidden neurons determined based on the dataset's features.

### 6. Plotting and Analysis

The neural network's architecture is visualized, and the weights are displayed to understand the model's internal representations.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis, follow the provided R code and ensure that the required libraries are installed. The code is well-documented to guide users through each step of the process.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code for your specific use case. If you have any questions or suggestions, please create an issue or reach out via the provided contact information.
